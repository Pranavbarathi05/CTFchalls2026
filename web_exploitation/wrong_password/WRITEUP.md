# Knowing Is Not Enough — Official Writeup

## Overview

This challenge is a **logic-based web exploitation task**.
The goal is not to bypass authentication, but to understand
how information is revealed through both success and failure.

---

## Step 1: Inspect Client-Side Data

Upon visiting the login page, a cookie is set:
auth_hint = 636c6f636b776f726b

Decoding this hex value yields: "clockwork"


This is the real password.

---

## Step 2: Trigger the Failure Path

Submitting an incorrect password reveals an encrypted blob:
LQkXGxQMFw0IG1cMHB4dBhsfBg8OFlk=

This is **not** the flag.

It is encrypted data.

---

## Step 3: Trigger the Success Path

Submitting the correct password (`clockwork`) reveals:
Key: TIME


Still no flag.

---

## Step 4: Combine the Pieces

The encrypted blob is:
- Base64 encoded
- XOR-encrypted using the key `TIME`

Decoding it recovers the flag.

---

## Example Decode Script

```python
import base64

cipher = "LQkXGxQMFw0IG1cMHB4dBhsfBg8OFlk="
key = "TIME"

data = base64.b64decode(cipher)
flag = ""

for i, b in enumerate(data):
    flag += chr(b ^ ord(key[i % len(key)]))

print(flag)


Final Flag:
DSCCTF{kn0w1ng_1s_n0t_3n0ugh_2026}
