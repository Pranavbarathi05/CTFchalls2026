## Challenge Description (for CTF platform)

🧠 Knowing Is Not Enough [web]

You found the login page.
You entered a password.
Something happened.

But was it really success?

This application behaves… strangely.
Failure reveals more than success ever will.

⚠️ WARNING: Being correct is not enough.
You’ll need to understand what you’re given — and why.

Can you put the pieces together?

## Deployment

### Using Docker (Recommended)

docker run -p 8000:8000 knowing-is-not-enough

The challenge will be available at:

Challenge Mechanics
1. Authentication Logic

A login form accepts a password.

Correct password does NOT reveal the flag.

Incorrect password reveals encrypted data.

This behavior is intentional.

2. Password Discovery

The real password is not guessable.

It is hidden client-side in an encoded form.

Players must inspect browser artifacts to recover it.

3. Split Knowledge

Wrong password → encrypted flag

Correct password → cipher key

Neither alone is sufficient.

The flag can only be recovered by combining both.
