Stranger Things: The Echo — Writeup
Overview

This challenge presents two nearly identical versions of the same page.
At first glance, everything appears normal.

The key insight is realizing that two different “worlds” exist, and the secret
is hidden in the differences between them, not in entirely new content.

Step 1: Explore the Application

Visiting the root endpoint:

/

returns a normal-looking page set in Hawkins.

The page displays calm, reassuring text:

Welcome to Hawkins
The town is quiet.
Everything is normal.
The lights are steady.

Inspecting the response headers reveals:

X-World: Normal

This suggests that the application may behave differently under another “world.”

Step 2: Discover the Upside Down

Given the Stranger Things theme and the response header,
it is reasonable to try accessing an alternative endpoint.

Visiting:

/upside-down

returns a page that looks almost identical to the original,
but subtle differences immediately stand out.

The response header now shows:

X-World: Upside-Down

Step 3: Compare Both Worlds

Although both pages share the same structure and wording,
careful comparison reveals intentional differences:

Letters replaced with numbers

Consistent leetspeak substitutions

Minor visual changes meant to be overlooked

Examples:

Welcome → Welc0me
normal → n0rmal
quiet → qu13t

These substitutions signal that the Upside Down version
cannot be trusted at face value.

Step 4: Identify the Hidden Message

At the bottom of the Upside Down page, an extra line appears
that is not present in the Normal version:

DO NOT TRUST THE LIGHTS

This line is the only new semantic content introduced in the Upside Down
and serves as a direct warning to the player.

Because it appears exclusively in the altered world,
it is the intended hidden message.

Step 5: Construct the Flag

Converting the hidden message into leetspeak to match the style of the Upside Down
and applying the standard flag format gives:

DSCCTF{d0_n0t_tru5t_th3_l1ght5}

Final Flag
DSCCTF{d0_n0t_tru5t_th3_l1ght5}
