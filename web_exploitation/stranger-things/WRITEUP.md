# Stranger Things: The Echo — Writeup

## Overview

This challenge presents two nearly identical versions of the same page.
At first glance, everything looks normal.

The key is realizing that **two different “worlds” exist**, and the secret
is hidden in the **differences between them**.

---

## Step 1: Explore the Application

Visiting the root endpoint:

/


returns a normal-looking page set in Hawkins.  
Nothing unusual is visible in the content.

Inspecting the response headers reveals:

X-World: Normal


This hints that more than one “world” may exist.

---

## Step 2: Discover the Upside Down

Given the Stranger Things theme and the response header,
it is reasonable to try accessing an alternative endpoint.

Visiting:

/upside-down


returns a page that looks almost identical to the original,
but something feels off.

The response header now shows:

X-World: Upside-Down


---

## Step 3: Compare Both Worlds

Although both pages share the same structure, careful comparison reveals
small but intentional differences:

- Letters replaced with numbers
- Subtle leetspeak substitutions
- Changes that are easy to miss at first glance

Examples:

Welcome → Welc0me
normal → n0rmal
quiet → qu13t


---

## Step 4: Extract the Hidden Message

By collecting the altered characters from the Upside Down page
and interpreting the substitutions, a phrase emerges:

UPSIDE DOWN IS IN THE DETAILS


This confirms that the differences themselves are the message.

## Step 5: Construct the Flag

Using the standard flag format and the extracted phrase, the final flag is:
