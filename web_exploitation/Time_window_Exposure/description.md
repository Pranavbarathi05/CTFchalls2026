⏱️ Time-Window Exposure [web]

This service always responds.
Permissions are not the problem.
Authentication is not the problem.

The server occasionally exposes sensitive information —
but only for a very brief moment.

Most of the time, you’ll see nothing useful.
Sometimes… timing is everything.

Can you catch it at the right moment?
