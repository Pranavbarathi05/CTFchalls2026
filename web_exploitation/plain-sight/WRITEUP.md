# In Plain Sight — Writeup

## Overview

This challenge hides the flag using visual effects rather than
encryption or server-side logic.

The flag exists directly in the HTML but is rendered unreadable
through CSS styling.

---

## Step 1: Inspect the Page

Visiting the page shows a normal layout.
No flag is immediately visible.

---

## Step 2: Inspect Elements

Inspecting the page reveals a `<div id="flag">`
containing the flag text.

However, it is unreadable due to styling.

---

## Step 3: Analyze CSS

The CSS applies two key rules to the flag:

- Text color matches the background
- A blur filter obscures the text

```css
color: #111;
filter: blur(6px);

Step 4: Reveal the Flag

By:
Disabling CSS
Removing the blur filter
Changing the text color
Or forcing hover styles
the flag becomes readable.
```
