# The Flag Is in the Cache — Writeup

## Overview

This challenge exploits a **client-side artifact** rather than a server bug.
The backend API clearly states the flag was removed.

However, browsers cache aggressively — especially with service workers.

---

## Step 1: Check the API

Requesting `/api/flag` returns:
{ "status": "removed" }


This appears to be a dead end.

---

## Step 2: Inspect Browser Storage

Opening DevTools → Application → Cache Storage reveals a cache named: archive-v1

Inside it is a cached response for `/api/flag`.

---

## Step 3: Extract Cached Response

The cached response contains:
RFNDQ1RGe3RoM19icjB3czNyX24zdjNyX2YwcmczdHNfMjAyNn0=


This is base64-encoded data.

---

## Step 4: Decode

Decoding the string yields:
DSCCTF{th3_br0ws3r_n3v3r_f0rg3ts_2026}
