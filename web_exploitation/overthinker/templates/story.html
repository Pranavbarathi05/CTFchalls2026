    <h2>The Lock</h2>

    <p>
        People say every lock has a secret.
        Some believe it is hidden.
        Others believe it is encrypted.
    </p>

    <p>
        You read it again.
        And again.
        Searching for patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
        But sometimes the answer is not hidden.
        Sometimes it is right in front of you.
        Simple.
