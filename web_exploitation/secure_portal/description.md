## Challenge Description

🛡️ Welcome to Secure Portal, our advanced user management system! This enterprise application manages user profiles and access controls.

You have access to a web application with user profiles. As a regular user, you can see your own profile which contains a partially masked flag. However, there might be other users with more complete information...

**Test Credentials:**
- Username: `user`
- Password: `password123`

**Your mission:** Find a way to access the complete, unmasked flag without knowing admin credentials.

---

## Access
- Web Application: `http://<server>:<port>`
- Login with the provided test credentials

---

## Your Profile Shows
```
Flag: DSCCTF{IDOR_████_█████_██████_████}
```

But surely there's a complete version somewhere...
