📱 Lying QR [steganography] 

You scanned it.
It gave you a flag.
Everything looks correct.

But something feels… wrong.

QR codes are more tolerant than you think.
Sometimes, they hide secrets in plain sight.

⚠️ WARNING: What you see is not always what you get.

Can you uncover the real message hidden inside?
