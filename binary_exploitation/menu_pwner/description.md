🔧 Menu Pwner [binary exploitation]

I built this tiny note manager for organizing my thoughts.
It has all the basic features you'd expect:
- Add notes
- Edit notes  
- Delete notes
- View notes

The code is pretty straightforward, but I've been having some weird crashes lately...

Maybe you can help me figure out what's wrong? 🤔

There's also an admin panel that I can't seem to access.
If you could help me get in there, I'd really appreciate it!
