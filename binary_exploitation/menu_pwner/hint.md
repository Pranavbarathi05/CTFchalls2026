# Hints (Progressive)

## Hint 1 (Free)
Look carefully at the delete function. What happens to the pointer after free()?

## Hint 2 (50 pts)  
Use-after-free vulnerabilities occur when memory is freed but the pointer isn't cleared. Can you still access deleted notes?

## Hint 3 (100 pts)
The debug stats show memory addresses. After freeing and reallocating, you might be able to control the content of freed chunks.

## Hint 4 (150 pts)
There's a function called `trigger_admin()` at address that can be found with objdump or gdb. You need to overwrite a function pointer or return address.

## Hint 5 (Full Solution)
1. Create a note
2. Delete it (but pointer isn't cleared - UAF!)  
3. Create a new note of same size (gets same chunk)
4. Put `trigger_admin` function address in the new note
5. Try to view/edit the deleted note - it will execute your controlled data
