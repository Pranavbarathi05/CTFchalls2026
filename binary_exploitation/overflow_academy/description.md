## Challenge Description

💥 Welcome to the Overflow Academy, where we teach the fundamentals of binary security!

This challenge teaches the basics of buffer overflows and memory exploitation. The binary has all protections disabled to make it beginner-friendly:

- No stack canaries
- No ASLR (addresses are leaked)
- Executable stack
- No PIE

Your goal is to overflow the buffer and redirect execution to your shellcode to spawn a shell and read the flag.

**Your task:** Exploit the buffer overflow to gain shell access and retrieve the flag.

## Hints

💡 **Hint 1 (Free):** The binary helpfully leaks the buffer address

💡 **Hint 2 (75 pts):** Calculate the exact offset to the return address

💡 **Hint 3 (100 pts):** Keep your shellcode under 100 bytes

💡 **Hint 4 (150 pts):** Standard `/bin/sh` payload works perfectly here

## Flag Format
