Hint 1 (Free / very light)

The server never gives you the flag directly.
But it does give you everything you need.

🟡 Hint 2 (50 pts)

The transformation is not random.
The same logic exists somewhere else.

🟠 Hint 3 (100 pts)

The protocol used by the server is also shipped to the browser.
Inspect the JavaScript carefully.

🔴 Hint 4 (150 pts – strong)

Try reversing what the JavaScript does.
Think about undoing each operation step by step.

🧨 Hint 5 (Full / emergency)

The transformation applies XOR and a position-based shift.
Undo it to recover the original message.
