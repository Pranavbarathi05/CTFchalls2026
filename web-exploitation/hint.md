# Hints

### Hint 1 (free)
The endpoint always works. The answer sometimes changes.

### Hint 2 (50 pts)
The server’s clock decides when the real flag appears.

### Hint 3 (100 pts)
Think in milliseconds. Automation beats manual refresh.

### Hint 4 (full)
The flag appears briefly once per minute. Script your requests.
