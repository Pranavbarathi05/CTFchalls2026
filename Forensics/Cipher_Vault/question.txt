🔐 Challenge — Cipher Vault

Category: Reverse Engineering + Cryptography
Difficulty: Medium–Hard

📖 Description

A secure vault program protects sensitive data.
The password is not stored in plain text.

Instead, the developer left behind an encrypted message using a classical cipher.

Break the cipher to recover the password, then use it to unlock the vault and retrieve the flag.
