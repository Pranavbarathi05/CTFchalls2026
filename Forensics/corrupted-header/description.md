📸 Corrupted Vacation Photo [forensics] - 100 pts

I was going through my old vacation photos and found this gem!

But something's wrong... the file won't open! 😢

My photo viewer says it's corrupted or not a valid JPEG file.
Can you help me fix it? There might be something important in this photo!

💡 Hint: All files have "magic bytes" at the start that identify the file type.
Maybe someone accidentally changed them?

**JPEG files should start with:** `FF D8 FF`

Tools you might need:
- Hex editor (HxD, hexedit, or even `hexdump`)
- Any image viewer to test if it works
