The investigation continues on Twitter. Look for the account that matches this pattern: @DSC_[CHALLENGE_TYPE]_2026

**Hiral's Share Comment:**
"The hunt intensifies! 🕵️‍♀️ As co-creator of Digital Footprints, I'm amazed by the community response.

**PART 2 OF 2 - COMPLETE THE PUZZLE:**
After you find our Twitter account and get the first half, you need to combine it with what's hidden in our Twitter banner image. The pattern is: [FIRST_HALF] + [BANNER_SECRET] = Next Platform

Remember: Twitter leads to Instagram, but only if you can decode both pieces correctly! 

The real treasure hunt begins when you complete the Twitter investigation. Each platform reveals one piece of a larger puzzle.

Can't wait to see who solves this first! 🚀

Spent weeks crafting the perfect OSINT investigation trail. The challenge needed to be:
✅ Educational yet challenging
✅ Multi-platform without being overwhelming  
✅ Technical but accessible to beginners

Working with @spaggetti99 (Hiral) has been incredible. She brought the social media intelligence expertise while I focused on the technical metadata aspects.

The most rewarding part? Watching participants connect the dots across platforms. Each clue builds on the last, creating a comprehensive learning experience.

Can't wait for the community to experience what we've built! 🚀

### Background Post 2: OSINT Methodology

**Post:** "OSINT Investigation Tip: Cross-Platform Correlation 🔗

One key skill every digital investigator needs is connecting information across multiple social media platforms. Here's my approach:

1️⃣ **Start with one verified account**
2️⃣ **Look for username patterns across platforms**  
3️⃣ **Check bio information for hidden clues**
4️⃣ **Analyze posting patterns and timing**
5️⃣ **Cross-reference shared content**

In our Digital Footprints challenge, participants will need to master these skills. The investigation spans LinkedIn → Twitter → Instagram, with each platform revealing crucial pieces of the puzzle.

The beauty of OSINT is that the information is all publicly available - you just need to know where to look! 👀

Excited to see how our community tackles this multi-platform investigation.
