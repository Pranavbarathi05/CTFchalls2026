I was worshipped before borders existed,

yet I left no coordinates behind.



Not dry, not dead — only displaced.

My path is written in dust, not ink.



Those who study me do not look at water,

they look at shadows in the sand.



Where three once agreed to meet,

only two still answer their names.



Empires drank from me, then buried me.

I was not lost — I was overwritten.



If you want my name,

search where satellites remember what maps forgot.
