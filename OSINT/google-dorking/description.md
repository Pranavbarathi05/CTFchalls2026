🔍 The Google Dorking Challenge [OSINT] - 100 pts

SecureTech Industries is a security company that provides enterprise solutions.

They have a website, but that's not all...
Sometimes companies accidentally expose internal documents online.

Your mission: Find the hidden document that contains sensitive information!

💡 Hints:
- Google is your friend
- Documents can be indexed by search engines
- The company domain is: securetech-industries.local (simulated)
- Think about what file types might contain internal information...

**For this challenge:** Since this is a simulation, you'll need to search through the provided files manually. In a real scenario, you would use Google dorks like:
`site:example.com filetype:pdf "confidential"`
