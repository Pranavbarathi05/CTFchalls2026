A former intelligence contractor disclosed highly classified material that triggered a massive global political crisis.

Soon after the disclosure, an international arrest warrant was issued against him while he was traveling internationally.

During this period, he became stranded in transit at an airport in a third country due to the sudden revocation of his passport by his home country, preventing him from continuing his journey.

Using only open-source information, identify the country where the individual was physically present **immediately before** he became stranded at that airport.

Important: The country you are looking for is **not** the United Kingdom (UK). The individual was not in the UK at any point during this sequence of events.
