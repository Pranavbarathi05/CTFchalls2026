## Challenge Description

🍕 Welcome to Caesar's Pizza Palace!

We've just received our encrypted menu for today's specials, but something went wrong with our decryption system. The menu contains a secret VIP item that has our flag, but we can't read it!

The menu seems to be encoded with some classical cipher method that Caesar himself might have used. Can you help us decrypt it and find the secret flag?

**Your task:** Decrypt the provided menu file and find the hidden flag.

## Hints

💡 **Hint 1 (Free):** Caesar was known for shifting letters in his messages

💡 **Hint 3 (75 pts):** ROT13 is a popular variant of the Caesar cipher

💡 **Hint 4 (90 pts):** Base64 encoding is often used for data transport, not security
