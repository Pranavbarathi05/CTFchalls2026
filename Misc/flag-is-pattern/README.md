## Challenge Description (for CTF platform)

🧩 The Flag Is the Pattern [misc]

You’re given a set of files.
They all look similar.
They all look useless.

But they were not placed here randomly.

Sometimes, the message isn’t in what you read —
but in how things are arranged.

Can you see the pattern?

## Files Provided

challenge/
├── data_0.txt
├── data_1.txt
├── data_2.txt
├── ...


Each file:
- contains random-looking text
- appears uninteresting on its own

1. **Hint 1 (free)**
