A classified, multi-volume government study analyzing internal policy
decisions over an extended period was disclosed to the public without
authorization.

Following initial publication, the executive branch sought an
extraordinary legal remedy to prevent further dissemination, arguing
that continued release would cause irreparable harm to national
interests.

The dispute escalated rapidly through the federal court system and was
resolved at the highest judicial level, setting a lasting precedent on
the limits of governmental power over the press.

Using open-source intelligence, identify the United States Supreme Court
case associated with this attempt to halt publication.
